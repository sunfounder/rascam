Get the IP Address
====================

Raspberry Pi will automatically connect to Wi-Fi after booting, we need to get the IP address of it. There are many 
ways to know the IP address, and two of them are listed as 
follows.

**Checking via Router**

If you have permission to log in the router (such as a home 
network), you can check the addresses assigned to Raspberry Pi on the admin interface of router. 

The default hostname of the system, Raspberry Pi OS is 
raspberrypi, and you need to find it. (If you are using ArchLinuxARM system, please find alarmpi.)

**Network Segment Scanning**

You can also use network scanning to look up the IP address of Raspberry Pi. 
You can apply the software, **Advanced IP scanner** and so on.

Scan the IP range set, and the name of all connected devices will be displayed. Similarly, the default hostname is 
raspberrypi, now you need to find the hostname.
